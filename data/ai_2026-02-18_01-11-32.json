    "description": "OAKLAND, Calif., Feb. 17, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enterprises deploying AI systems with excessive permissions experience 4.5x more security incidents than those enforcing least-privilege controls, according to a new research report from Teleport. Based on interviews with 205 CISOs, security architects, and platform leaders, The 2026 State of AI in Enterprise Infrastructure Security finds that AI is moving into production infrastructure faster than identity controls can keep pace, creating a measurable security gap.Key FindingsAI adoption is widespread, but governance lags:92% have near-term AI initiatives in production85% worry about AI-related infrastructure risk59% report or suspect an AI-related incident70% say AI has more access than a human in the same role69% believe identity management must fundamentally change Access scope - not AI sophistication - was the strongest predictor of outcomes. Organizations with over-privileged AI reported a 76% incident rate vs. 17% for least-privilege deployments.\"The data is clear,\u201d said Ev Kontsevoy, CEO at Teleport. \"It\u2019s not the AI that\u2019s unsafe. It\u2019s the access we\u2019re giving it.\u201dConfidence Isn\u2019t SecurityOrganizations most confident in their AI deployments experienced more than double the incident rate of less confident peers. Visibility is also limited: 43% report AI makes autonomous infrastructure changes monthly, while 7% don\u2019t know how often.With 79% evaluating agentic AI but only 13% highly prepared, the gap is widening. A full 67% still rely on static credentials - correlating with higher incident rates - and only 3% use automated controls governing AI behavior. To address this, leaders should:Replace static credentials with strong identity for humans and AIEnforce least privilege by designMove governance controls to machine speedAbout the ReportCommissioned by Teleport and conducted by Eleven Market Research in December 2025, the study surveyed organizations with 500-10,000+ employees.Download the full report and read our blog.About TeleportTeleport, the AI Infrastructure Identity Company, establishes a unified identity layer for infrastructure - humans, machines, workloads, and AI agents - secured cryptographically.

    "description": "Normally, when big-name talent leaves Silicon Valley giants, the PR language is vanilla: they\u2019re headed for a \u201cnew chapter\u201d or \u201cgrateful for the journey\u201d \u2014 or maybe there\u2019s some vague hints about a stealth startup. In the world of AI, though, recent exits read more like a whistleblower warnings.Over the past couple of weeks, a stream of senior researchers and safety leads from OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and others have resigned in public, and there\u2019s nothing quiet or vanilla about it. Take, for example, OpenAI researcher Zoe\u0308 Hitzig. She chose not to quietly flip her LinkedIn profile but to announce her resignation in a New York Times guest essay entitled, \u201cOpenAI Is Making the Mistakes Facebook Made. I Quit.\u201d Who resigns that way \u2014 in the Times? What ticked her off was OpenAI\u2019s decision to start testing ads inside ChatGPT. Ironically, in 2024 Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, had said, \u201cI hate ads,\u201d arguing that \u201cads plus AI\u201d ... are \u201cuniquely unsettling\u201d because people are forced to figure out who is paying to influence them with the answers. But, hey, when even OpenAI\u2019s internal bean counters expect the company to lose $14 billion in 2026 alone, Altman managed to get over his qualms.Not so, Hitzig. She wrote, \u201cPeople tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems, their beliefs about God and the afterlife. Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don\u2019t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.\u201d (She\u2019s right, of course.)But, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s naive. Facebook didn\u2019t make a mistake. It made billions of dollars by exploiting people who shared things online with families and friends. It\u2019s been a truism in internet business models since the late 2000s that, \u201cIf you\u2019re not paying for the service, you are the product.\u201dSure, intimate disclosures married to an ad business via AI is a creepy construct. So is Facebook and X\u2019s ability to profit from getting people to fall down the rabbit hole of engagement, outrage, and behavior profiling. But no one\u2019s stopping them. Heck, back in 2016, Facebook shared its data with Cambridge Analytica, allowing the Trump campaign to customize ads at an almost individual level, helping Donald Trump win the 2016 election. That eventually cost Facebook about $6 billion dollars in fines and lawsuits. That sounds like serious money until you consider that Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, had GAAP revenue in 2025 over $200 billion, almost all of it from advertising. I have a feeling Altman will get over his queasy feeling about that kind of revenue.Meanwhile, over at Anthropic, the departing head of the Safeguards research team, Mrinank Sharma, was even more direct. In a resignation letter shared with the world on X, he wrote that \u201cthe world is in peril.\u201d He described, in the sort of polite but pointed language that sets off lawyers, how hard it is in practice for a company to \u201clet our values govern our actions\u201d when the money, the market, and the internal prestige all point toward shipping more capable models, faster. Here, again, we see ethics taking a back seat to profits. Mind you, Anthropic is the AI company that branded itself around \u201cconstitutional AI\u201d and careful deployment. If senior safety leaders there feel they can no longer put morality ahead of cash, that\u2019s a red flag.If this were just about two idealistic researchers taking a stand, you could write it off as personality and politics. It isn\u2019t. OpenAI recently disbanded its \u201cmission alignment\u201d team, which was to work on making AI safe. (Don\u2019t forget, OpenAI started as a nonprofit funded by donations and pledges rather than equity investment and dedicated to ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) would benefit \u201call of humanity.\u201d)Today, OpenAI and Anthropic are positioning themselves for IPOs to realize billions for their owners and eventual shareholders. As anyone who pays attention to the stock market since ChatGPT 3.5 exploded on the scene in 2023 knows, the market is dominated by the AI-driven Magnificent Seven with its $20.2 trillion in market cap. And you wonder why people are worried about an AI bubble popping!? There are other AI leaders headed for the door. At Elon Musk\u2019s xAI \u2014 now freshly folded into SpaceX via an all\u2010stock deal \u2014 xAI co\u2010founders Tony Wu and Jimmy Ba headed to the lifeboats while Musk talked about \u201creorgs\u201d and how \u201csome people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.\u201d Sure, Elon, sure. Meanwhile, VERSES AI\u2019s founders and CEO are out as the board installs an interim leader and pushes a sharper commercial pivot. Even Apple is suffering an \u201cAI brain drain.\u201d There, Senior Vice President John Giannandrea and Siri leader Robby Walker have left for Meta.Each individual story is different, but I see a thread here. The AI people who were concerned about \u201cwhat should we build and how to do it safely?\u201d are leaving. They\u2019ll be replaced by people whose first, if not only, priority is \u201chow fast can we turn this into a profitable business?\u201d Oh, and not just profitable; not even a unicorn with a valuation of $1 billion is enough for these people. If the business isn\u2019t a \u201cdecacorn,\u201d a privately held startup company valued at more than $10 billion, they don\u2019t want to hear about it.I think it\u2019s very telling that Peter Steinberger, the creator of the insanely \u2014 in every sense of the word \u2014 hot OpenClaw AI bot, has already been hired by OpenAI. Altman calls him a \u201cgenius\u201d and says his ideas \u201cwill quickly become core to our product offerings.\u201d Actually, OpenClaw is a security disaster waiting to happen. Someday soon, some foolhardy people or companies will lose their shirts because they trusted valuable information with it. And, its inventor is who Altman wants at the heart of OpenAI!?Gartner needs to redo its hype cycle. With AI, we\u2019re past the \u201cPeak of Inflated Expectations\u201d and charging toward the \u201cPinnacle of Hysterical Financial Fantasies.\u201dThe people leaving before it all goes to hell? They\u2019re the wise ones.",
