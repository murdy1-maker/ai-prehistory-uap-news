    "description": "On Mars, the amount of ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation that reaches the surface is sufficiently deleterious for life as we know it. However, it has been predicted that some ancient lakes on Mars had high concentrations of Fe3+, an ionic species known for a high absorption of UVC radiation. Some models of UV attenuation have [...]The post Modeling Photoprotection of Ultraviolet C Radiation by Ferric Ions and Implications for the Habitability of Ancient Martian Lakes appeared first on Astrobiology.",
