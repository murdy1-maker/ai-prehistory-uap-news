Newly released police logs and leaked video contradict the official explanation that a UK police helicopter simply mistook an American F-15 fighter jet for drones. The NPAS helicopter was reportedly \u201ctargeted\u201d and pursued by two fast-moving unidentified craft over RAF Lakenheath, forcing pilots into an emergency dive to avoid a crash. Witnesses and experts say the mysterious objects matched the helicopter\u2019s speed and performed manoeuvres impossible for jets or known drones. Watch this video to know more.",
