    "description": "Lakkundi(Gadag district): The historic village of Lakkundi, renowned for its temple architecture and Chalukyan legacy, has once again captured the attention of Karnataka with the discovery of an ancient cache of gold ornaments believed to date back to the era of kings. The remarkable find, made during foundation digging at a residential site on January 10, Saturday has sparked widespread curiosity among historians, archaeologists and the general public. The treasure was discovered at a house plot belonging to Gangavva Basavaraj Ritti, located in Ward Number Four of Lakkundi village. During excavation work for laying the foundation, an eighth-standard student, Prajwal Ritti, noticed a copper pot buried underground. According to preliminary information, the discovery occurred between 2.30 pm and 3.30 pm on the day of excavation. At first glance, it was not clear what the pot contained, but upon closer inspection, gold ornaments were found inside. What has drawn particular praise is the honesty and presence of mind shown by young Prajwal, who acted with maturity beyond his age. Instead of attempting to conceal the find, he immediately informed village elders, members of the gram panchayat and former district panchayat president Siddu Patil. Siddu Patil, in turn, relayed the information to Gadag district in-charge minister H.K. Patil, setting in motion an official and lawful response. Following the minister\u2019s directions, all concerned officials rushed to Lakkundi to verify the facts on the ground. The entire process was conducted strictly as per the legal procedures. Video recording was carried out and a formal panchanama was prepared in the presence of four witnesses\u2014two government-appointed panchas and two respected village elders acting as unofficial witnesses. Senior officials, including the taluk tahsildar and ADC-level officers, were present throughout the proceedings to ensure transparency. In the presence of all officials and witnesses, the copper pot containing the treasure was opened. A detailed inventory of the contents was prepared on the spot. The seized items were then formally handed over to the tahsildar through the rural inspector, as mandated by law. Officials have confirmed that the valuables are in the process of being transferred to the government treasury for safe custody.

Based on current market rates, the monetary value of the gold alone could be approximately \u20b960 to \u20b965 lakh. However, officials and experts have stressed that the historical and archaeological value of the artefacts may far exceed their present-day market price. The exact age, origin and cultural significance of the ornaments will be determined only after a detailed examination by specialists from the Archaeology Department. The copper pot reportedly contained gold chains, expensive bangles and rings with intricate and distinctive designs. The craftsmanship has led experts to believe that the ornaments are not of recent origin. Adding to the intrigue is the fact that an ancient Lakshmi temple stands adjacent to the house where the treasure was found. This has given rise to speculation that the gold ornaments may have once belonged to the temple and were hidden for safekeeping during a period of invasion, unrest or political turmoil. Lakkundi occupies a special place in Karnataka\u2019s history. Known as the \u201ccradle of sculpture\u201d, the village is famous for its 11th and 12th century temples and stepped wells. Historical records and folklore often describe Lakkundi as a settlement that once boasted 101 temples and 101 wells, reflecting its prosperity during the Kalyana Chalukya period. The village is a living testimony to the architectural brilliance and economic affluence of that era. Soon after the discovery, officials from the Lakkundi Development Authority visited the site and conducted an initial inspection. The district administration has taken control of the location and there is a strong possibility of further excavation in and around the area, as authorities believe more archaeological material could be buried underground.",
