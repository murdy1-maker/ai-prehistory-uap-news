    "description": "Phenom, the leader in applied AI that helps organisations hire faster, develop better and retain longer, has announced a suite of its advanced applied AI innovations for HR at IAMPHENOM India 2025 in Bengaluru. This marks a significant step in modernising how Indian enterprises attract, develop and retain talent across both knowledge and frontline roles.Built on Phenom X+ Ontologies, these products adapt to industry nuances, the distinct needs of knowledge workers and frontline teams, and regulatory requirements. Traditional talent approaches have created persistent gaps where strategic priorities do not translate into hiring plans, workforce data rarely turns into coordinated action, and promising talent remains stuck in silos.Key Applied AI Innovations AnnouncedThese capabilities enable Indian enterprises to connect business strategy with talent execution, automate complex workflows, improve hiring integrity and deliver more personalised candidate and employee experiences in real time.Candidate Fraud Detection Agent \u2013 Industry\u2019s first fraud detection AI agent that safeguards hiring integrity by identifying potential candidate deception without slowing decision-making. The agent analyzes candidate responses, verifies identities, detects resume falsification, and flags AI-assisted interview responses in real time. Post-interview analyses are also provided, compiling fraud indicators for interview team review.Enterprise Talent Optimization & Work Redesign \u2013 Breakthrough capability that connects business strategy directly to workforce execution. AI analyses work at the task level, dynamically mapping the strategic initiative to required roles and skills highlighting tasks that can be automated or AI-augmented, as well as employee development plans that link to measurable business outcomes.Unified Orchestration Engine \u2013 An adaptive orchestration layer that keeps complex HR workflows running smoothly, handling exceptions in real time. The engine uses decision intelligence and simulations to identify operational bottlenecks, create alternate pathways when rules don\u2019t fit, and ensure actions are policy-compliant and explainable, keeping a human in the loop.Frontline Workforce Lifecycle & Shift Scheduling \u2013 End-to-end AI support for India\u2019s frontline workforce, including compliant shift scheduling, internal mobility, referrals, communication and alumni engagement. AI agents optimize shifts based on skills, preferences and availability, enabling organisations to strengthen redeployment and rehiring for part-time or seasonal roles.Voice Screening Agent \u2013 Always-on, conversational voice-based AI that orchestrates the entire candidate screening process across high-volume, frontline, knowledge, and executive-based roles. The agent conducts role-specific voice interviews, probes into qualifications, and assesses fit before advancing qualified candidates to the next step, boosting recruiter efficiency and candidate experience.\u201cIndia\u2019s talent landscape is evolving rapidly, and HR teams need applied AI that not only improves efficiency but closes the persistent gaps between workforce data, strategy and execution,\u201d said Hari Bayireddi, President, COO & Co-founder, Phenom. \u201cWith these innovations, we\u2019re enabling organisations in India to connect strategy, skills and execution whether it\u2019s accelerating hiring, redesigning work, or protecting the integrity of every hire.\u201dFocus on Applied AI for HR ExcellencePhenom\u2019s applied AI differs from generic AI by leveraging HR-specific data models that understand how talent decisions connect to organisational outcomes.
