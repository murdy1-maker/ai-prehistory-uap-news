    "description": "The Brahmastra is often described as a divine weapon, yet many ancient texts hint at a power comparable to or even greater than modern nuclear technology. References in the Mahabharata and Ramayana describe blinding light, massive destruction and radiation-like effects that puzzle researchers even today.
