The administration will not oppose rules governing AI and kids safety, he added.Major AI players including ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Alphabet\u2019s Google, Meta Platforms, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz have said the federal government, not states, should regulate the industry.Yet state leaders from both major political parties have said they need the power to put guardrails around AI, particularly as Congress has consistently failed to pass laws governing the tech industry.Trump threatens funding for states over AI regulationsFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has proposed an AI bill of rights that includes data privacy, parental controls and consumer protections. California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose state is home to several major AI companies, signed off on a bill this year requiring major AI developers to explain plans to mitigate potential catastrophic risks.Other states have passed laws banning AI-generated nonconsensual sexual imagery and unauthorized political deepfakes.",
