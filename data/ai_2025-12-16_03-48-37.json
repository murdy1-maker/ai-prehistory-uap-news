    "description": "Copilot may be the least respected AI in Big Tech, but Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman continues to impress. He\u2019s the Phil Spencer of AI, a plain-spoken and honest human being who in this case succeeds at making sense of AI in ways that anyone can understand and with little of the robotic coldness we see in Sam Altman and other AI leaders. In a world shifting inexorably to AI capabilities and workloads, he may be Microsoft\u2019s greatest single asset.I\u2019m serious. Suleyman is the antidote to a very real problem: Big Tech\u2019s incessant over-marketing of AI, over-spending on AI infrastructure, and over-promising of capabilities that are in no way ready for prime time are undermining customer trust. Microsoft, sadly, is no stranger to trust problems. But it seems a bit tone-deaf to this reality, and its heavy-handed AI push is alienating customers, eroding trust further.This is unfortunate because we\u2019re inundated by new AI models and the useful new capabilities they bring on an almost weekly basis. And yet, there are still AI deniers and doubters out there, babbling incessantly about hallucinations, \u201cslop,\u201d and whatever else, driving a wave of misinformation that feeds on distrust and then needlessly amplifies it. It\u2019s not clear which is less desirable, the noise from this crowd or the noise of Big Tech pushing AI so aggressively.They\u2019re both terrible. So last week, I wrote When AI Works \u2b50 to cut through all that noise. It\u2019s a look at what AI is and is not capable of right now that highlights about a dozen high-level areas in which improvements from AI are undeniable. I am not a gullible AI cheerleader, but I am also not a change-averse Luddite trying to prevent progress because I feel threatened. As I do in all things, I have a centrist view of AI, which is just technology. And while there are exaggerations and a kind of \u201cfake it until you make it\u201d mentality that pervades in this industry, there are also many examples of where AI is already making our lives better by saving us time and/or money while opening up new, previously unimagined new capabilities.That is not how Microsoft or any other Big Tech company promotes AI, of course. And that is why Suleyman is so special. He clearly understands the Microsoft AI marketing playbook from front to back, but he just as clearly can\u2019t bring himself to not be open and honest about what works and what doesn\u2019t. He isn\u2019t afraid to call BS on anything Microsoft or its competitors are doing. And because of his history, he\u2019s not just an expert, he\u2019s an insider. He is, in short, someone I feel we can trust.The most recent example of Suleyman\u2019s uniquely human approach to AI comes via an extensive interview with Bloomberg. (In addition to the article and video within, there is a longer version of the interview in podcast form on iHeart Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and elsewhere, too.) I strongly recommend that everyone reading this listen to that or...The post Microsoft AI Chief Succeeds Where Copilot Does Not \u2b50 appeared first on Thurrott.com.",
