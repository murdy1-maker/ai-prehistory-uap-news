    "description": "China has approved its first batch of Nvidia\u2019s H200 artificial intelligence chips for import, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking a shift in position as China seeks to balance its AI needs against spurring domestic development.The approval covers several hundred thousand H200 chips and was granted during Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang\u2019s visit to China this week, the sources said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.The first batch of approvals has been allocated primarily to three major Chinese internet companies, with other enterprises now joining a queue for subsequent approvals, one of the sources said.They declined to name the companies that received the initial clearances.China\u2019s industry and commerce ministries, as well as Nvidia, had not yet responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.The H200, Nvidia\u2019s second most powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing\u2019s hesitation to allow imports has been the main barrier to shipments.The U.S. earlier this month formally cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 to China, where the company is seeing a strong appetite.However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be shipped in.It was unclear in recent weeks whether Beijing would approve, as the government wants to balance meeting surging domestic demand for advanced AI chips and nurturing its domestic semiconductor industry.Chinese customs authorities told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month.But Chinese technology firms have placed orders for more than two million H200 chips, far exceeding Nvidia\u2019s available inventory, Reuters reported last month.It remains uncertain how many additional companies will receive approval in subsequent batches or what criteria Beijing is using to determine eligibility.Huang arrived in Shanghai last Friday for routine annual celebrations with Nvidia\u2019s China employees and has since travelled to Beijing and other cities, Reuters reported last week.The approvals of H200 suggest Beijing is prioritising the needs of major Chinese internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centres needed to develop AI services and compete with U.S. rivals, including OpenAI.While Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the performance of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip, previously the most advanced AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, they still lag far behind the H200.The H200 delivers roughly six times the performance of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip.Still, Beijing has discussed requiring companies to buy a certain quota of domestic chips as a condition for receiving approval to import foreign semiconductors, Reuters previously reported.",
