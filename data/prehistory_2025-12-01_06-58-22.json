Accompanied by an academic report by Dr Raffaele D\u2019Amato and early photographs taken before cleaning, it is estimated at \u00a360,000-\u00a380,000.Another star attraction is a large late Roman mosaic panel featuring 18 charming parakeets arranged in lively standing and perching poses. Comparable to an example in the Louvre, the panel measures an impressive 831\u20442 by 803\u20444 inches and dates to the late Roman period. Its provenance includes a 1960s Montreal collection and Archaeologia Gallery in the 1980s. Estimate: \u00a330,000-\u00a340,000.The classical offerings continue with a finely carved Roman marble figure of Mithras-Sabatios, the Phrygian deity depicted on horseback in a belted tunic, Persian trousers and flowing riding cloak.

Estimate: \u00a312,000-\u00a317,000.Among the small antiquities is a delightful Roman sardonyx cameo ring (2nd-3rd century AD) carved with a peacefully sleeping dog and inscribed in ancient Greek. The inscription translates to \"Be wakeful\u201d or \"(seal) of Gregory.\u201d Formerly in an English private collection (1970s-1990s), it is estimated at \u00a31,500-\u00a32,000.From the early civilisations of Central Asia comes a Bactrian bronze zebu bull vessel with stopper, dating to the 1st Millennium BC. Its heavy dewlap and wide curving horns mark it as a classic emblem of authority in early Indus Valley culture.
