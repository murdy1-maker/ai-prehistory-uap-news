    "description": "Hanwha Life said Thursday that it has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) translation assistant designed to help foreign financial planners prepare for certification exams. The assistant is the first AI-powered learning support tool in the industry. It provides learning videos in Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese, along with multilingual practice questions and mock exams. As all features are mobile-based, foreign financial planners can study anytime, anywhere with ease. For example, videos originally available only in Korean are now dubbed in Chinese or Vietnamese using the AI assistant. AI-generated explanations help users understand concepts and terms in their native language when solving practice questions, and an automatic wrong-answer review feature helps them focus on areas needing improvement. Hanwha Life currently employs more than 1,600 foreign financial planners, with the majority from China (1,498) and Vietnam (71). The company said the service was introduced to meet the growing demand for a multilingual training environment and enhance access to learning. \"The AI translatio",

    "description": "Although financial authorities relaxed network-separation regulations last year for the first time in a decade, the changes have yet to ease operational difficulties for financial companies, industry insiders said Thursday. While the revision allows firms to use generative artificial intelligence (AI), each time an AI model\u2019s name or version is updated, companies must obtain new approval from authorities, a process that can take several months. According to industry sources, a major financial firm secured regulatory sandbox approval earlier this year to launch a service based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and has recently completed its system setup. However, with the debut of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5.1 earlier this month, the firm now faces the need to reapply for sandbox designation and repeat the approval process to implement the latest model. The situation has raised concerns that cumbersome regulations are hindering AI adoption in the financial sector, even as the Lee Jae Myung administration aims to position Korea among the world\u2019s top three AI leaders. The network-separation regulation was intro",
