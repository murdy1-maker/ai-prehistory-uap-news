    "description": "This Deal adds $70M of Nvidia GPUs to AlphaTON\u2019s Balance Sheet, combining with the $27M Digital Asset Treasury to total $97M in Total Assets.Dover, DE, Nov. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AlphaTON Capital Corp. (Nasdaq: ATON) (\"AlphaTON\" or the \"Company\"), a digital asset technology company focused on the Telegram and TON ecosystem, today announced it has entered into agreements to acquire and deploy a 1,000+ Nvidia B200 GPU high-performance compute cluster valued at approximately $68 million. This strategic infrastructure investment positions AlphaTON as a critical compute provider for Telegram\u2019s Cocoon AI - the world\u2019s largest decentralized, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence network, while creating a diversified revenue stream through high-performance compute and GPU rental services.TRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND FINANCINGThe transaction will be financed through a strategic capital structure consisting of:$30 million in equity capital from AlphaTON Capital Corp.$52.5 million in debt financing to be facilitated by Vertical Data\u2019s GPU Financing divisionTotal project capitalization of approximately $82.5 million (includes additional working capital and deployment costs)Total of $70M of high-value Nvidia hardware assets added to the balance sheet The debt facility facilitated by Vertical Data to be fully amortized over 36 months, with the project maintaining debt service coverage ratios above 1.0x throughout the amortization schedule. The compute cluster will be held as a revenue-generating hard asset on AlphaTON's balance sheet.STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERSHIPAlphaTON has assembled a consortium of best-in-class infrastructure partners to deploy and operate the GPU cluster:CUDO Compute - A leading European NVIDIA Cloud Partner (NCP), will serve as the primary deployment and operations partner for the GPU infrastructure. CUDO will lead cluster installation, orchestration, workload management and lifecycle operations, while also providing the commercialization engine through its GPU marketplace and AI services platform. CUDO\u2019s operational stack ensures production-grade uptime, enterprise-grade telemetry and scalable multi-tenant governance across the full cluster.SNET Energy UK Ltd - Providing expertise in sustainable-power data center development and AI infrastructure optimization, SNET Energy's involvement ensures technical excellence and alignment with decentralized AI principles.Vertical Data - Beyond debt financing, Vertical Data will provide the GPU cluster and deployment services, and hardware sourcing.HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS AND CAPABILITIESThe compute cluster will feature 1,000+ Nvidia B200-class GPUs, representing cutting-edge AI inference and training capabilities. The infrastructure is designed with a modular, upgradable architecture to accommodate rapid evolution in AI hardware and model architectures. The cluster will operate at 90% target utilization, serving dual revenue streams:Dedicated Workloads for Cocoon AI - Priority allocation for Telegram/Cocoon AI's proprietary, privacy-preserving AI networkExternal GPU Rentals - Monetization through CUDO Compute's marketplace, initially for bare metal compute and progressively for AI servicesCOMPELLING PROJECTED PROJECT ECONOMICSThe investment presents institutional-grade returns with strong downside protection:Projected IRR: 59.7%Projected NPV: $59.6 millionProjected Equity Multiply: 5xProjected ROI: 615%Projected Total Cash returned (5-year projection): $150 million Revenue projections incorporate conservative assumptions, including 20% annual price compression in the first year and 10% in the following years, 90% utilisation rates, and comprehensive operating cost inflation. The financial Model demonstrates consistent EBITDA margin ranging from 64-73% over five year forecast horizon, with Year 1 gross profit margins of 32%SUCCESSFUL PILOT LAUNCHED ON NOVEMBER 25, 2025AlphaTON Capital announced the successful completion of a landmark pilot program utilizing Telegram\u2019s innovative Cocoon AI infrastructure, a milestone made possible through a strategic collaboration that granted the firm early access. \"Our strategic partnership with Telegram and Cocoon provided early access to the technology, and we successfully launched a Cocoon pilot on November 25, 2025,\" said Logan Golema, CTO of AlphaTON Capital. \"Following this validation, we are now going to deploy the technology into our secure and decentralized AI hosting infrastructure to further enhance our network's scalability and performance.\"STRATEGIC RATIONALEDemocratizing AI with \"AI For Good\u201dAs Artificial Intelligence becomes increasingly centralized among a few global technology giants, AlphaTON is committed to an \"AI For Good\u201d mandate. This initiative prioritizes ethical access, user data sovereignty, and environmental responsibility. By supporting Cocoon, AlphaTON is helping to build a sovereign compute layer where user data remains encrypted and private, and where content rights are respected-a direct alternative to the surveillance-capitalism models prevalent in the industry today.\"We believe the future of AI must be decentralized, private, and accessible to all, not hoarded within the walled gardens of Big Tech,\u201d said Brittany Kaiser, Chief Executive Officer of AlphaTON Capital. \"This investment is not just about hardware; it is a commitment to ethical infrastructure. By powering Project Cocoon, we are giving Telegram\u2019s nearly one billion users access to AI tools that respect their privacy and freedom, while ensuring our investors have direct exposure to the most valuable asset class of the next decade: sovereign compute.\u201dALIGNMENT WITH COCOON AI'S DECENTRALIZED VISIONCocoon AI, leveraging Telegram's 1 billion+ monthly active user base, is building a privacy-first alternative to centralized AI services dominated by Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft/OpenAI. Cocoon's approach-running AI models on decentralized infrastructure with user data sovereignty-requires compute resources that are not owned, monitored, or controlled by Big Tech competitors.AlphaTON's GPU cluster provides Cocoon AI with:Guaranteed Performance and Uptime - Dedicated capacity free from cloud provider throttling or resource contentionData Sovereignty - Complete control over data boundaries, ensuring user privacy is architecturally protectedInfrastructure Independence - Freedom from platform risk and competitive intelligence exposure inherent in Big Tech cloud servicesEconomic Value Capture - Direct ownership eliminates cloud intermediary margins, improving unit economicsDEPLOYMENT TIMELINE AND COMMERCIAL MILESTONESQ4 2025: Transaction close, establishment of asset holding structure, Cocoon AI testing and launch on first fleet of machinesQ1 2026: Hardware delivery, validation of workloads, performance benchmarking, security audits, and soft launch for Cocoon AI inferenceQ2 2026: Implementation of full Cocoon AI workloads; expansion of cluster orchestration capabilities; Planned expansion with 2-4 additional clusters, subject to market conditions and initial performance validationMARKET CONTEXT AND COMPETITIVE POSITIONINGThe investment comes at an inflection point in AI infrastructure markets. According to McKinsey analysis, data center AI workload capacity will grow 3.5x between 2025 and 2030, adding 124 gigawatts of incremental capacity. However, value capture is heavily skewed toward technology and chipmakers (60% of spending) versus real estate (15%) and power (25%). AlphaTON's model captures hardware asset appreciation while generating recurring rental revenue, positioning across multiple value pools.The U.S. government's unprecedented 10% equity stake in Intel and the characterization of AI infrastructure as \"buyer of last resort\" by federal policymakers signal systematic support for the sector. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated to the BBC, an AI infrastructure bubble burst would represent \"a total market contagion event,\" effectively designating the sector as too integral to fail.About AlphaTON Capital Corp.
