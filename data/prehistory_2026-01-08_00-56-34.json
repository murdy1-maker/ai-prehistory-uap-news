    "description": "\u201cWeird spiderwebs appearing at odd hours of the night in Rockstar\u2019s open world game Red Dead Redemption 2?\u201d you chortle. \u201cThat sounds like the testimony of crazy old Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, the guy who writes about new Molyneux projects like a pauper child returning from market with a handful of magic beans\u201d. Mates, I promise I haven\u2019t fallen victim to a scam of some kind. There are weird spiderwebs in RDR2. I read about it on the internet! The spiderwebs appear to be part of a huge Easter egg puzzle the community (aka Youtubers, Xitter users and redditors) are now attempting to solve \u2013 an Easter egg that has allegedly lain uncracked since the game\u2019s initial release in 2018. Spoilers to follow, of course. Read more",

    "description": "Researchers have reconstructed ancient herpesvirus genomes from Iron Age and medieval Europeans, revealing that HHV-6 has been infecting humans for at least 2,500 years. Some people inherited the virus directly in their DNA, passing it down across generations. The study shows that these viruses evolved alongside humans\u2014and that one strain eventually lost its ability to integrate into our chromosomes. It\u2019s the first time this long, intimate relationship has been proven with ancient genetic evidence.",
