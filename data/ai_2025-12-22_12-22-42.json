    "description": "Summary:Apple plans AI glasses and AI-enhanced AirPods next yearTwo smart-glasses models planned, with and without displayDisplay-free glasses may launch first using voice-based AIAI AirPods to feature spatial recognition and gesture controlsTaiwan supply chain plays central role in productionApple is preparing to expand its artificial-intelligence hardware strategy with the launch of two new AI-enabled wearable devices next year, according to media reports citing supply-chain sources that I can dig up. The push is expected to include smart glasses and a new generation of AI-enhanced AirPods, marking Apple\u2019s most ambitious move yet to embed generative AI into everyday consumer hardware.Reports says Apple is developing two variants of smart glasses. The first, known internally as the N50 model, will not include a display and is targeted for release as early as 2026. Instead, the device is expected to rely on voice-based AI interactions, positioning it as a lightweight, always-on assistant rather than a full augmented-reality product. A second version featuring an integrated display is reportedly further out, with a launch window seen in 2027 or 2028 as Apple continues to refine optics, battery life and on-device processing.In parallel, Apple is also planning to roll out AI-enhanced AirPods Pro next year. The updated earbuds are expected to incorporate an infrared lens capable of spatial recognition, enabling new gesture-based controls and more immersive contextual awareness. Such features would allow the AirPods to interact more closely with a user\u2019s surroundings, laying the groundwork for deeper integration with Apple\u2019s broader AI and spatial-computing ecosystem.Supply-chain involvement points to a heavy reliance on Apple\u2019s long-standing Taiwan manufacturing partners. Foxconn is expected to handle assembly, while TSMC will supply key chips. Optical components are reportedly being sourced from Largan Precision, with hinges provided by Shin Zu Shing.Strategically, the wearables push underscores Apple\u2019s intention to bring AI closer to the user, moving beyond cloud-centric services and smartphones. By embedding AI directly into personal devices, Apple aims to create a more seamless, ambient computing experience \u2014 one that could eventually serve as a bridge toward full augmented-reality hardware later in the decade.
