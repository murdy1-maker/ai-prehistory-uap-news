    "description": "Scientists have uncovered how cannabis evolved the ability to make its most famous compounds\u2014THC, CBD, and CBC\u2014by recreating ancient enzymes that existed millions of years ago. These early enzymes were multitaskers, capable of producing several cannabinoids at once, before evolution fine-tuned them into today\u2019s highly specialized forms. By \u201cresurrecting\u201d these long-lost enzymes in the lab, researchers showed how cannabis chemistry became more precise over time\u2014and discovered something unexpected: the ancient versions are often more robust and easier to work with.",
