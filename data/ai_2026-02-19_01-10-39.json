    "description": "AN INDIAN professor has faced backlash after suggesting that a robot dog displayed at a major AI summit in New Delhi was developed by her university, even though the model is sold by Chinese startup Unitree.The silver mechanical dog was displayed at a booth run by the private Galgotias University at the AI Impact Summit this week.In a televised interview on Tuesday, professor Neha Singh introduced the robot to an Indian TV reporter and said it had been developed by the university.\u201cYou need to meet Orion,\u201d Singh told the reporter as the robot dog performed tricks such as waving at the camera and springing up on its hind legs.\u201cThis has been developed by the centres of excellence at the Galgotias University,\u201d Singh said, while speaking about the institution\u2019s investments in artificial intelligence.\u201cAs you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes... it\u2019s quite naughty also,\u201d she said.After the comments triggered online criticism, Galgotias University issued a statement on social media platform X.\u201cLet us be clear -- Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed,\u201d the university said.It said the \u201crecently acquired\u201d Unitree robodog is a \u201cclassroom in motion\u201d and that \u201cour students are experimenting with it, testing its limits\u201d.The university added that while it did not build the machine, \u201cwhat we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies\u201d.Singh later told reporters on Wednesday that \u201cthings may not have been expressed clearly\u201d.\u201cI did not communicate it properly,\u201d said Singh, a professor of communications.Galgotias student Vaidik Mishra said the controversy was unnecessary.\u201cWe were so hopeful that this summit would give us a platform to talk about our start-up. But now it is all about us lying about the robot, which is not even true. It was just a misunderstanding,\u201d he told AFP.India\u2019s opposition Congress party used the incident to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is hosting nearly 20 world leaders and dozens more national delegations at the five-day summit.\u201cThe Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own,\u201d the party wrote in a post on X.\u201cThis is truly embarrassing for India,\u201d it added, calling the incident \u201cbrazenly shameless\u201d.The TV reporter who conducted the interview, Tapas Bhattachary, asked viewers to take a wider view.\u201cIf one out of hundreds of exhibitors wasn\u2019t being upfront about their innovation, I would not give up on the entire India\u2019s youth who are very innovative,\u201d Bhattachary said.(With inputs from agencies)",
