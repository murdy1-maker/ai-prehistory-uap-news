    "description": "President Vladimir Putin warned that artificial intelligence must not create a divide between a small elite capable of real thinking and a majority reduced to \"pushing buttons\", stressing that Russia must avoid losing a generation unable to handle basic academic tasks or understand history. During a meeting of the Council for Civil Society Development and Human Rights, he also claimed the Ukraine conflict began when Kyiv launched military action against those who rejected the 2014 change of government, saying Russia is trying to end the war. The session addressed family support, disability rehabilitation, palliative care and the safety of modern technologies.",
