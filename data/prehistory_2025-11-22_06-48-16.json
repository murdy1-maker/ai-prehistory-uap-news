    "description": "Suleyman Elcin/Anadolu via Getty ImagesArchaeologists have opened the hermetically sealed sarcophagus of a young Roman woman that was untouched since she was buried. The intact tomb was found underneath the capital of Hungary, Budapest, in the O\u0301buda district. It had not been looted, and the skeleton inside was entirely uninterfered with, offering researchers a valuable insight into life 1,700 years ago. The New York Post reports that \u201cglass vessels, bronze figures and 140 coins,\u201d were found inside. The find was made by researchers from the Budapest History Museum in a quarter of the ancient Roman city of Aquincum that had been vacated in the third century. Gabriella Fe\u0301nyes, lead archeologist on the excavation, said, \u201cThe peculiarity of the finding is that it was a hermetically sealed sarcophagus. It was not disturbed previously, so it was intact.\u201d The size of the skeleton, along with the items found, suggests it was a young woman inside the sarcophagus. They included the \u201citems given to the deceased by her relatives for her eternal journey,\u201d Fe\u0301nyes said. \u201cThe deceased was buried very carefully by her relatives. They must have really loved who they buried here.\u201dRead it at New York Post Read more at The Daily Beast.",
