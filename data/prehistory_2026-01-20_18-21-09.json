    "description": "Sensitive hearing may have evolved in mammal ancestors far earlier than scientists once believed. By modeling how sound moved through the skull of Thrinaxodon, a 250-million-year-old mammal predecessor, researchers found it likely used an early eardrum to hear airborne sounds. This challenges the long-held idea that these animals mainly \u201clistened\u201d through their jaws or bones. The results reveal that a key feature of modern mammal hearing was already taking shape deep in prehistory.",
