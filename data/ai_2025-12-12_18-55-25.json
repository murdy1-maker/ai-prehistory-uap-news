    "description": "STORY: U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order on artificial intelligence that will attempt to preempt a growing number of state laws governing the technology with a national standard.He said such laws could undermine U.S. efforts to maintain tech dominance over China.\"It's a big part of the economy. And there's only going to be I think, one winner here. I don't know if anybody agrees with that. I think most people agree. But there's only going to be one winner here. And that's probably going to be the U.S. or China. And right now, we're winning by a lot.\"Critics, however, warn that unchecked AI development could put Americans at risk.Major AI players like OpenAI, Google and Meta have said the federal government, not states, should regulate the industry.\"We have the big investment coming. But if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it's not possible to do, especially if you have some hostile. All you need is one hostile actor and you wouldn't be able to do it.\"Yet state leaders from both major political parties have said they need the power to put guardrails around AI, particularly as Congress has consistently failed to pass laws governing the tech industry.Just last month, New York became the first to enact a law requiring online retailers that employ so-called \"surveillance pricing\" to disclose their use of algorithms and customers' personal data.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has proposed an AI bill of rights that includes data privacy, parental controls and consumer protections.California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose state is home to several major AI companies, signed off on a bill this year requiring major developers to explain plans to mitigate potential catastrophic risks.However, Trump said Thursday he could withhold federal broadband funding from states whose laws are seen to hold back U.S. dominance of the new technology.",
