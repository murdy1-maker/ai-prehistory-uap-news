    "description": "A new \u201ccottage industry\u201d of specialised agencies for artificial intelligence (AI) companies has reportedly emerged in China. These agencies are helping AI companies to pass rigorous government ideological tests required for public launch, a report claims. This test falls under rules formalised in November that require AI models to handle a 2,000-question exam correctly and to refuse to answer at least 95% of prompts designed to trigger politically sensitive or subversive content. According to a Wall Street Journal report, these agencies operate like test-prep services, helping companies train their chatbots to navigate the Chinese government\u2019s strict censorship requirements.",
