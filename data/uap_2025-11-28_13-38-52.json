    "description": "Is A Trump UFO Bombshell Incoming? Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,Documentary filmmaker Dan Farah has boldly predicted that President Trump could be the first world leader to spill the beans on UFOs, dropping a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d about non-human tech and extraterrestrial intel\u2014sparking feverish speculation: Is this engineered hype to divert from global flashpoints, or a seismic shift toward transparency? Farah made the claim on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast while promoting a new documentary titled The Age of Disclosure. As Farah teases amnesty for black-budget insiders, is Trump poised to unmask aliens, or is this another misdirect?Farah asserted: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it happens soon after the film comes out \u2014 the sitting president has to step to the microphone and say: humanity is not alone in the universe. We have recovered technology of non-human origin. So have other nations. There is a high-stakes, secret cold war race to reverse engineer this technology. We need to win this race.\u201d UFO expert Dan Farah just told Joe Rogan he believes a sitting president will finally come clean about the UAP phenomenon...and he thinks that president will be Donald Trump.Then he dropped a bombshell about what Trump has already tasked Tulsi Gabbard with investigating.... pic.twitter.com/TsMb2WRm2q\u2014 Overton (@overton_news) November 21, 2025Rogan quipped, \u201cI think Trump might be the only guy that\u2019s willing to do something that crazy.\u201d Farah replied: \u201cI know he is aware of what people in his administration say in the film... And I know that they are discussing internally how they\u2019re going to react to the film publicly.\u201dThe filmmaker also claimed that Trump was contemplating basic disclosure during his first tenure as President and has now tasked United States Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard with getting to the bottom of what is gong on with the UFO/UAP phenomenon.Throughout the podcast he detailed how insiders have revealed to him that there have been multiple UFO contact events with the U.S. military, including multiple face to face encounters with non-human entities.Dan Farah tells Joe Rogan there have been multiple UFO contact events with our military and even describes the types of beings involved. ? pic.twitter.com/weBCa1fbIz\u2014 Astral?

I need to know what they learned, because taxpayers paid for this and it\u2019s in our interest to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d But is this real reckoning or red herring? Intelligence Whistleblower Edward Snowden\u2019s warned in 2023 that such flaps are \u201cengineered\u201d to bury scandals like Nord Stream.\u201cI wish it were aliens,\u201d but it\u2019s bait to \u201cwipe the infinitely more awkward Seymour Hersh story from the headlines,\u201d he noted at the time.Farah also claimed that according to insiders, over a trillion dollars has been poured into \u201creverse-engineering\u201d recovered craft.Ex-intel officer Luis Elizondo\u2019s 2024 drone-UFO intercept revelations\u2014\u201ctrue UAP events followed by a Department of Defense response\u201d\u2014have hinted at a hidden arms race.In 2023 the NSC claimed that UAPs are having a \u201creal impact\u201d on pilots\u2014claiming \u201cthere\u2019s something our pilots are seeing.\u201dWhite House National Security Council Coordinator, Admiral John Kirby was asked about Senator Schumer\u2019s UAP legislation. ?-White House takes it seriously\u201cSome of these phenomena we know have already had an impact on our training ranges.\u201d pic.twitter.com/CNeJ8Efj6z\u2014 UAP News (@HighPeaks77) July 17, 2023Under Trump, could this be significant truth-telling, unearthing black-budget secrets?
