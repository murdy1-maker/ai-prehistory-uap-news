    "description": "The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is upgrading an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform for virtual asset surveillance as part of efforts to crack down on increasingly sophisticated market manipulation, the watchdog said Monday. The platform, Virtual Assets Intelligence System for Trading Analysis (VISTA), is designed to process massive volumes of trading data, automatically flag abnormal transactions and visualize trading behavior. The financial watchdog said VISTA has already become a core investigative tool in crypto-related enforcement cases. Last December, FSS expanded its computing capacity by installing two new servers equipped with high-performance central and graphics processing units. Leveraging this infrastructure, the agency has developed an automated detection model that identifies suspected price-rigging periods without manual intervention. The system scans every possible trading interval \u2014 from seconds to months \u2014 and calculates abnormal trading metrics across all segments, allowing authorities to uncover manipulation patterns regardless of how frequently",
