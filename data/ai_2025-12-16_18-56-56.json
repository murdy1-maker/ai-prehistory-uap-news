    "description": "Korean artificial intelligence (AI) models being developed under the government\u2019s bid to assert technological sovereignty were found to lag behind leading overseas systems in tests modeled on the College Scholastic Ability Test and in advanced, essay-style mathematics questions. The comparison was conducted by a research team led by Kim Jon-lark, a professor of mathematics at Sogang University, which asked 10 large language models to solve a total of 50 questions. The set comprised 20 advanced CSAT mathematics problems, covering calculus, probability and statistics, geometry and common subjects, along with 30 essay-style questions drawn from top South Korean universities, Indian entrance examinations and graduate-level tests at the University of Tokyo. Overseas models took the top spots. Google\u2019s Gemini 3 Pro Preview ranked first with 92 points, correctly solving 46 of the 50 questions. Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic followed with 84 points, while Grok 4.1 Fast from xAI scored 82. GPT-5.1 from OpenAI earned 80 points, and China\u2019s DeepSeek V3.2 posted 76 points. By contrast, the per",
