It is about designing workflows where agentic AI operates at scale and humans are purposefully deployed to manage decisions, exceptions, and accountability. That is how real execution happens.\u201dAt the core of XBP Global\u2019s approach is agentic AI\u2010driven execution, where autonomous and semi\u2010autonomous AI agents handle repeatable work while human\u2010in\u2010the\u2010loop ensure trust, governance, and control. This hybrid execution model enables enterprises to move from experimentation to production\u2010grade hyper\u2010automation that delivers measurable value.Through the Enabling the Next Era of Hyper\u2010Automation campaign, XBP Global highlights its ability to:Design and operate end\u2010to\u2010end intelligent workflowsEmbed agentic AI as a core execution enginePurposefully integrate human\u2010in\u2010the\u2010loop decision frameworksDeliver outcome\u2010centric value across industries and the public sector By integrating advances in open\u2010source and proprietary AI models with institutional knowledge and deep domain expertise, XBP Global is fundamentally redesigning how workflows across complex enterprise environments are driving productivity, resilience, and long\u2010term value creation.The campaign will be reflected across XBP Global\u2019s thought leadership, business unit initiatives, partner ecosystem, and talent brand, reinforcing a unified vision for intelligent execution in the age of hyper\u2010automation.Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.
