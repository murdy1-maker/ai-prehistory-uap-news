    "description": "Bad news for PlayStation 3 owners hoping to watch Love is Blind on their CRT: Netflix is discontinuing the streaming app from Sony's legacy console a month from now.A Reddit post from a CRT-enthusiast community shared the announcement seen on the PS3 Netflix app, which reads: \"Unfortunately, Netflix will no longer be available on this device after March 2, 2026.\"Streaming services phasing out support for older devices shouldn't be a surprise, but what's striking about this shutdown is how long the PS3 Netflix app was functioning. Netflix launched for PS3 in late 2009--but due to an exclusivity deal that the streaming giant had with Xbox, the service was only available through a disc that the company sent in the mail. It took until later in 2010 for Netflix on PS3 to go disc-free with a downloadable app. Netflix had a similar arrangement for the Wii, but that app was discontinued in 2018.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The fastest land animal in North America is the American pronghorn, and previously, researchers thought it evolved its speed because of pressure from the now-extinct American cheetah. But recently, that theory has come under fire. Now, a University of Michigan study examining fossilized ankle bones of ancient relatives of the American pronghorn has shown that the pronghorn was evolving to be faster more than 5 million years before the American cheetah appeared on the continent. The study is published in the Journal of Mammalogy.",
