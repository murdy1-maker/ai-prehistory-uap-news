    "description": "GADAG: Lakkundi, renowned as the \u201cland of temples\u201d and a living testament to the artistic brilliance of the Kalyani Chalukyas, has once again drawn national attention with the discovery of rare archaeological remains. During the second day of excavation at the historic Veerabhadreshwara temple complex inside the Lakkundi fort, archaeologists unearthed ancient artefacts believed to be associated with Shaivite worship, including a Shiva linga pedestal and structures resembling a panibattalu (ritual water outlet). The findings have generated widespread curiosity among historians, scholars, and heritage enthusiasts, as experts believe the relics could provide crucial insights into the religious practices and temple architecture of the early medieval Deccan. Archaeologists involved in the excavation described the discovery of the Shiva linga base as a significant indicator of long-standing Shaivite traditions at the site, reinforcing Lakkundi\u2019s reputation as an important spiritual and cultural centre. Also Read: Somnath: Civilisational continuity and the resurgence of Bharat The excavation, carried out by the Archaeology Department, began early in the morning and is being conducted in a phased and scientific manner. On the second day, digging was undertaken across an area of nearly 10 square metres, extending deeper than the initial exploratory trenches. The work was formally inaugurated a day earlier by Gadag Deputy Commissioner C.N. Sridhar, who is also the chairman of the Lakkundi Development Authority. According to officials, the excavation is expected to continue for nearly two months, as preliminary findings suggest the presence of multiple layers of historical occupation beneath the temple courtyard. Experts believe further digging could reveal additional architectural elements, sculptures, or inscriptions that may help establish a clearer timeline of the site\u2019s evolution. In order to ensure that the excavation proceeds without disturbance, the district administration has declared the area a \u201csensitive zone.\u201d Acting on the recommendation of the Archaeology Department, the Deputy Commissioner has imposed a complete ban on public entry into the excavation site until the work is completed. Photography and videography in the restricted zone have also been prohibited, a move aimed at protecting fragile artefacts and maintaining scientific integrity during the process. However, the restrictions have triggered unease and resistance among local residents and temple devotees. Many fear that the ongoing excavation could disrupt the famous Veerabhadreshwara Jatre, an annual religious festival held in March that has been observed continuously for nearly five decades. Locals have expressed concern that the digging is taking place near the area traditionally used to build the sacred fire pit (agnikunda) for the festival rituals. Adding to the discontent are allegations that the temple committee was not adequately informed before the excavation began. Community members argue that while archaeological research is important, it should not come at the cost of long-standing religious practices and local traditions. \u201cOur rituals and festivals are part of living heritage. They must be respected alongside historical conservation,\u201d locals have demanded. Officials have maintained that efforts will be made to strike a balance between archaeological exploration and religious sentiments.",
