    "description": "India has set out a strategic roadmap to accelerate domestic capabilities in robotics and physical artificial intelligence, signalling a push to reduce dependence on imported hardware and proprietary software while positioning the country as a competitive global supplier of intelligent machines. The plan, prepared by the Technology Advisory Group for Emerging Technologies, places indigenisation, software sovereignty and sector-focused deployment at the centre of the national approach, with healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, agriculture and media production identified as priority domains.The roadmap comes as governments worldwide race to translate advances in artificial intelligence into physical systems that can operate autonomously in real-world environments. While software-led AI has seen rapid adoption, policymakers argue that long-term economic and strategic gains will hinge on control over robotics hardware, operating systems and embedded intelligence. India\u2019s proposal reflects concerns that reliance on imported robots and closed platforms could expose critical sectors to supply-chain risks and limit domestic innovation.At its core, the strategy seeks to build a full-stack robotics ecosystem, spanning sensors, actuators, edge computing, operating software, cloud integration and safety certification. Officials involved in drafting the document have stressed that the objective is not isolation but resilience, with domestic alternatives developed alongside international collaboration. The roadmap calls for common standards and open architectures to prevent vendor lock-in and to allow startups and research institutions to build interoperable systems.Healthcare has emerged as an early focus area, driven by workforce shortages and rising demand for precision care. The roadmap highlights surgical assistance, rehabilitation devices, hospital logistics robots and elder-care support systems as near-term opportunities. Policymakers note that such applications demand high reliability and ethical safeguards, reinforcing the need for locally controlled software stacks and transparent algorithms. Parallel efforts are proposed to strengthen clinical validation pathways and align regulatory approvals with global benchmarks.Manufacturing and logistics form another pillar, with the document pointing to collaborative robots, autonomous guided vehicles and smart warehousing as tools to raise productivity and improve workplace safety. India\u2019s manufacturing sector, dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, has historically lagged in robot adoption due to cost and skills barriers. The roadmap recommends targeted incentives, shared testing facilities and modular designs to lower entry thresholds, alongside large-scale skilling programmes to train technicians, operators and system integrators.Agriculture features prominently, reflecting policy priorities around food security and rural incomes. The plan outlines the use of robotics for precision spraying, harvesting, soil analysis and post-harvest handling. Developers are encouraged to design systems suited to fragmented landholdings and diverse crops, rather than importing models built for large, mechanised farms elsewhere. Officials argue that domestically developed agricultural robots could also find markets across Asia and Africa, where similar conditions prevail.An unusual inclusion is the media and creative sector, where robotics and physical AI are seen as enablers of immersive production, automated camera systems and smart broadcasting infrastructure. The roadmap suggests that integrating robotics with virtual production and generative tools could lower costs for newsrooms and studios while enhancing safety in hazardous reporting environments.Beyond sectoral applications, the strategy places strong emphasis on software sovereignty. It calls for homegrown robotics operating systems, simulation platforms and AI frameworks that can be audited and customised. While global open-source projects are acknowledged as valuable foundations, the document urges sustained public funding to ensure domestic stewardship and long-term maintenance. Data governance and cybersecurity are flagged as critical, particularly for robots deployed in sensitive locations.Financing and procurement reforms form another strand. The roadmap proposes dedicated funding windows for deep-tech robotics ventures, longer grant cycles to reflect extended development timelines and clearer pathways from research labs to commercial deployment. Public procurement is positioned as a market-shaping tool, with government agencies encouraged to pilot domestically developed robots in hospitals, warehouses and public infrastructure.The roadmap also addresses ethical and social dimensions, including job displacement concerns and safety standards. Rather than framing robotics as a threat to employment, the document argues that productivity gains can create new roles in design, maintenance and supervision, provided reskilling keeps pace. It recommends national guidelines for human\u2013robot interaction, liability frameworks and continuous monitoring of societal impact.The article India maps a self-reliant path for robotics and physical AI appeared first on Arabian Post.",
