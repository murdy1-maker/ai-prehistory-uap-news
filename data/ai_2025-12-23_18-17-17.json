    "description": "Prosperr.io, a Bangalore-based fintech SaaS company building AI-powered tax management infrastructure, has raised $4M in seed funding. The round was led by Jungle Ventures, with participation from Yatra Angel Network, Sadev Ventures and other strategic investors. This brings Prosperr.io\u2019s total capital raised to $5.55M since its founding in 2022.`This investment underscores Jungle Ventures\u2019 high-conviction strategy of backing high-calibre, second-time founders and experienced industry operators who bring deep domain expertise and executional maturity. The firm partners with founders building foundational infrastructure layers in fintech, commerce, energy and enterprise software\u2014sectors where Jungle has backed industry-defining companies now exceeding USD 15 billion in cumulative enterprise value across global markets.Founded by Manas Gond and Dev Kumar, both with engineering backgrounds, Prosperr.io is tackling one of fintech\u2019s most persistent blind spots\u2014the operational complexity of managing tax in increasingly fragmented and global financial environments. As individuals earn across multiple income sources and businesses expand across jurisdictions, tax compliance has struggled to keep up. For salaried individuals, Prosperr.io is building an always-on taxation platform that adapts to the user\u2019s financial goals, unlocking eligible deductions with proactive adviser communication. Prosperr.io also offers tax-saving employee allowances and simplified employee reimbursement using automation and artificial intelligence for enterprises, which enables them to proactively support the financial well-being of their workforce.\u201cWe\u2019re building Prosperr.io as the AI-powered financial operating system for working India,\u201d said Manas Gond, CEO and Co-Founder, Prosperr.io. \u201cOur integrated Flexi Benefit Plan and Super Saver Plan are transforming how businesses and individuals handle tax, savings, and compliance. With 3x YoY revenue growth, this round accelerates our AI and product roadmap to serve millions with smarter, more compliant financial solutions,\u201d he added.The company recently expanded its enterprise product suite with an AI-powered reimbursement solution to address the growing complexity of corporate tax operations.\u201cTax is one of the most under-innovated layers of financial infrastructure, and the complexity only compounds as individuals earn across multiple streams and businesses operate global workflows,\u201d said Rishab Malik, Partner, Seed Investments, Jungle Ventures. \u201cProsperr.io fits squarely into Jungle\u2019s thesis of backing founders who are solving deep, structural problems with strong technical insight. Their ability to embed AI directly into compliance, deduction, and reimbursement workflows is creating a new category of tax infrastructure for both individuals and enterprises.\u201dSince its previous funding round, Prosperr.io has delivered 5x revenue growth while expanding its product suite across both B2B and B2C segments, and currently maintains 80% retention across its consumer business and 100% retention across enterprise clients.The company plans to use the new funding to accelerate product development and strengthen its B2B sales infrastructure as the company scales its enterprise platform and expands into new markets like wealth management and other adjacent business lines.",
