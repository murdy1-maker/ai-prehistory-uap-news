It\u2019s physicsWith another set of global climate talks behind us, the Australian government faces some tricky tasks before it takes over negotiations at the next round of talks next year in Turkey. Cop30 in Bele\u0301m, Brazil, did not deliver the bold fossil fuel phase-out roadmap we needed, but it did nudge the system forward with more scrutiny of fossil fuel producers. And despite the weakness of the outcome, one can gain some important comfort by the fact that Be\u0301lem \u2013 and the G20 in Johannesburg at the weekend \u2013 both solidly endorsed the Paris agreement, its central goal of keeping warming to 1.5C and the importance of net zero emissions. Cop30 agreed that an \u201cambition accelerator\u201d will be needed to fill the gap between what governments are planning (projected to warm the world by 2.6C) and the agreed guardrails of the Paris agreement: a limit of 1.5C. It also, crucially, began the momentum for developing a roadmap for a just transition away from fossil fuels, with more than 80 countries \u2013 including Australia \u2013 signing the \u201cBele\u0301m declaration\u201d on a transition away from fossil fuels.While this declaration didn\u2019t get support from the whole conference, Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz Ina\u0301cio Lula da Silva, has promised to move forward on its implementation during the course of this year, until he hands over to Cop31 in Turkey.
