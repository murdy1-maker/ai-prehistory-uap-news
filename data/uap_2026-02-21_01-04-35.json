    "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbonkers\u201d announcement Thursday that he plans to release government files related to alien life raised an immediate red flag for some journalists, and two of whom warned that the announcement was a clear smoke screen to distract the public from something far more nefarious.Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump announced that he would be ordering federal agencies to \u201cbegin the process\u201d of releasing government files \u201crelated to alien and extraterrestrial life\u201d and \u201cUFOs.\u201d The announcement, made amid the United States inching closer to a \u201cfull-fledged war\u201d with Iran, immediately caught the attention of journalist Lee Fang, who highlighted a historical CIA document that bore a striking resemblance to current events. Fang flagged one CIA document in particular: a 1954 telegram from the CIA, which was issued amid the CIA\u2019s Operation PBSuccess, a covert effort to overthrow the democratically elected president of Guatemala, Jacobo A\u0301rbenz, after his administration had enacted land reforms that cut into the profits of the United Fruit Company, which the CIA described as an \u201cattack\" on the American company.In the telegram, the CIA lists methods of de-emphasizing media coverage of the covert operation, among them being a method involving \u201cflying saucers.\u201d\u201cIf possible, fabricate big human interest story, like flying saucers, birth sextuplets in remote area to take play away,\u201d the CIA telegram reads.Given the timing of Trump\u2019s UFO announcement \u2013 issued as the Trump administration has mobilized a colossal military force near Iran, with an all-out war possibly imminent \u2013 journalist and author Max Blumenthal bemoaned what he suggested was Trump\u2019s tactic to draw attention away from the potentially catastrophic consequences of a wider regional war.\u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d Blumenthal wrote bluntly in a social media post on X Thursday night. \u201cAgain.\u201dIt\u2019s happening. Again. https://t.co/NxbcAmhvu9\u2014 Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) February 20, 2026",
