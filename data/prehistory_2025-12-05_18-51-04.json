    "description": "New research reveals ancient humans in southern Africa lived in isolation for nearly 100,000 years. This led to unique genetic traits not seen in modern populations. These findings show human evolution was complex, involving multiple isolated groups. The study analyzed genomes from 28 ancient individuals, offering insights into early human diversity and adaptation.",
