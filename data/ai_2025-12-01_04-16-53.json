    "description": "GLOBE Telecom Inc. on Sunday said that it had saved more than 11.3 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity last year, equivalent to approximately P125 million, by using artificial intelligence (AI) to drive smarter and more efficient energy use across its network and facilities.The telco said the savings were realized through a combination of energy management programs and two AI solutions deployed to almost 20,000 network elements across the country.\u201cThese AI-driven solutions show that resource efficiency and sustainability go hand-in-hand,\u201d Globe Senior Vice President Joel Agustin said in a statement.The telco said that by embedding AI and machine learning into network operations, it managed to significantly reduce electricity use in thousands of cell sites and buildings without compromising service quality.The impact was said to be significant as the tools optimized energy use, including the adjustment of power consumption at the cell-site level.In its buildings, Globe said AI was also making cooling systems more efficient via external digital demand-response technology, which has shown annual energy savings of around 20 to 30 percent.\u201cTechnology allows us to respond in real time. It\u2019s a smarter way to manage energy because the system knows when to ramp up or slow down, depending on demand,\u201d Agustin said.Globe shares on Friday added P32.00, or 2.04 percent, to close at P1,602 each.
