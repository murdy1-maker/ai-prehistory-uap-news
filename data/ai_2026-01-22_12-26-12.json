    "description": "To strengthen computing power reserves, the capexs of the four major cloud service providers (CSPs) are expected to remain strong in 2026 and support industry development. These investments are cascading downstream, creating large-scale AI server deployment projects that not only boost the performance of upstream and downstream electronic components and system assembly factories, but also drive pre-shipment electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) verification demand as product power design moves toward a megawatt-level high-power trend. This has accelerated the influx of professional electronic testing firms.",

    "description": "Korea on Thursday formally enacted a comprehensive law governing the safe use of artificial intelligence (AI) models, becoming the first country globally in doing so, establishing a regulatory framework against misinformation and other hazardous effects involving the emerging field. The Basic Act on the Development of Artificial Intelligence and the Establishment of a Foundation for Trustworthiness, or the AI Basic Act, officially took effect Thursday, according to the science ministry. It marked the first governmental adoption of comprehensive guidelines on the use of AI globally. The act centers on requiring companies and AI developers to take greater responsibility for addressing deepfake content and misinformation that can be generated by AI models, granting the government the authority to impose fines or launch probes into violations. In detail, the act introduces the concept of \"high-risk AI,\" referring to AI models used to generate content that can significantly affect users' daily lives or their safety, including applications in the employment process, loan reviews and medical ad",
