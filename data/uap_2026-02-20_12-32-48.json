    "description": "Trump Has A UFO Speech Ready To Deliver Documentary filmmaker Dan Farah appeared on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast in November to promote his new documentary, The Age of Disclosure, and predicted that his film might force Trump to become the first world leader to confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life publicly.\"I wouldn't be surprised if it happens soon after the film comes out \u2014 the sitting president has to step to the microphone and say: humanity is not alone in the universe,\u201d Farah told Rogan. \u201cWe have recovered technology of non-human origin. So have other nations. There is a high-stakes, secret cold war race to reverse engineer this technology. We need to win this race.\u201d \u201cI think Trump might be the only guy that\u2019s willing to do something that crazy,\u201d Rogan replied.Well, now Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, let it slip during an appearance on the New York Post's Pod Force One podcast that Trump has a speech prepared confirming extraterrestrial life exists.\u201cDo you think that he's about to make an announcement about UFOs?\" host Miranda Devine asked.\u201cBecause President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president.\u201d\u201cWell, I said this in my podcast, too,\u201d Lara Trump began.\u201cWhat's funny is we've kind of asked my father-in-law about this, 'cause we're like, \u2018Well, what do you know?\u2019 \u2018Cause, Miranda, we all wanna know about the UFOs, or we all wanna know what's going on and he played a little coy with us. And so that, of course, led us to believe, Eric and I, were like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, if he won't even, like, fully tell us, maybe there's more to it.\u2019 And then I have just heard kind of around that... I think he's actually said it, I think my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has that, I guess, at, at the right time, and I don't know when the right time is, he's gonna break out and, and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak.\u201dLara Trump suggests that President Trump is ready to make an announcement to the world about the existence of aliens, with his script already prepared for the \u201cright time.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to talk about maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know when the right time... pic.twitter.com/D3Cp4zTjFV\u2014 Shadow of Ezra (@ShadowofEzra) February 18, 2026The White House offered exactly the kind of answer you'd expect. \u201cI\u2019ll have to check in with our speech writing team,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline said.\u201dThat would be of great interest to me personally, and I\u2019m sure all of you in this room and apparently former President Obama, too.\u201dA clip from Obama's recent appearance on Brian Tyler Cohen\u2019s podcast went viral over the weekend after he was asked point-blank whether aliens exist.\"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51 ... There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,\" Obama said. Barack Obama on aliens: \u201cThey\u2019re real\u201d\u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen them. They\u2019re not being kept at Area 51. There\u2019s no underground facility \u2014 unless there\u2019s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the President of the United States.\u201d pic.twitter.com/c6t0DYxewU\u2014 UAP James (@UAPJames) February 14, 2026By Sunday, Obama was on Instagram trying to walk it back.\"Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances aliens have visited us is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\" Obama wrote. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama)Washington's relationship with UFOs \u2014 or, in the preferred bureaucratic phrasing, Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) \u2014 has shifted considerably in recent years. A House hearing in July 2023 featured testimony from former military intelligence officer David Grusch, who told lawmakers under oath that he \"was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program to which I was denied access.\" Grusch further alleged the government had retrieved what he called \"non-human biologics\" from recovered craft, citing accounts from dozens of witnesses he interviewed over four years.The Pentagon, of course, pushed back. A March 2024 report rejected the core claims \u2014 no reverse-engineered alien spacecraft, no hidden extraterrestrial biological material, no off-world technology stashed in some classified warehouse. The agency stood by its denials even as lawmakers held classified briefings.Lara Trump\u2019s comment adds new intrigue to the discussion. Whether Trump eventually delivers that address \u2014 or whether this is one more piece of carefully managed intrigue from a president who has never met a story he didn't know how to control \u2014 is a question that, for now, has no answer. But Trump sure does seem like the president who would do so. Tyler DurdenThu, 02/19/2026 - 14:00",
