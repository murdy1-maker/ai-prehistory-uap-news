    "description": "Was Lanka truly the golden kingdom of Ravana, or is the truth far more complex than the legends suggest? Drawing insights from the Surya Siddhanta and the interpretations of Bala Sankuratri, this discussion explores ancient astronomical references, geography, and scriptures. It examines how time, latitude, and celestial calculations connect Lanka to Vedic knowledge. The narrative goes beyond mythology to uncover symbolic and scientific meanings hidden in the texts. A thought-provoking journey into where history, astronomy, and belief intersect.",
