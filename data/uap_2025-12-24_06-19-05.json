    "description": "A private jet pilot flying over Rhode Island reported a bizarre encounter with a small silver UFO at 3,500 feet, sparking questions about unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) in U.S. airspace. The pilot described the object as hovering beside the aircraft, appearing to stand still before disappearing. Air traffic control confirmed no other sightings, while the FAA states that corroborated reports are shared with the UAP Task Force. This follows similar sightings, including one over a U.S. air base in Britain in 2024, fueling speculation about alien or secret aerial technology.",
