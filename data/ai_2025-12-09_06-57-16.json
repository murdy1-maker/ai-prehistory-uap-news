    "description": "OpenAI has turned off ads appearing on ChatGPT while it works out how best to improve the model\u2019s precision, its top researchers said.In early December, a user complained about the nonsensical way in which ChatGPT was showing ads for Target below a conversation the user was having about Windows\u2019 BitLocker. In repsonse, Mark Chen, the chief research officer at OpenAI, said that the company would look into the situation.Late on Friday, Chen confirmed that the ads had been paused. \u201cI agree that anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care, and we fell short,\u201d Chen said in a post on Twitter / X. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model\u2019s precision. We\u2019re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don\u2019t find it helpful.\u201dThis interaction with ChatGPT prompted a user to complain that ads were being unnecessarily added to ChatGPT.As LLMs have emerged as an alternative to search, their owners have wrestled with how to monetize the queries their users enter. Some, like Google Gemini, have turned to AI Mode, slurping up third-party content recommendations and aggregating them, with tiny links back to the original source of content. Microsoft\u2019s Copilot has also occasionally embedded ads, though they\u2019re much less frequent on searches that I have made personally.The story was originally reported by The Verge.",
