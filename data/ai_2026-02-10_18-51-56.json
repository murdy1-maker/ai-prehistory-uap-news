    "description": "A week after the News Service reported on an AI-assisted political ad, the Massachusetts House is poised to pass legislation targeting the use of artificial intelligence in elections.The House plans on Wednesday to take up a bill that was being released Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee. The legislation aims to address election misinformation by prohibiting candidates from distributing \u201cwith actual malice materially deceptive audio or visual media\u201d with the intent to harm a candidate\u2019s reputation or deceive voters about when, where or how to vote within 90 days of an election. The final section of the redraft states the measure would not apply to \u201cmaterially deceptive audio or visual media or materially deceptive election-related communication that constitute satire or parody.\u201d The News Service on Feb. 3 reported on a Brian Shortsleeve ad that his gubernatorial campaign said was parody.The redrafted Rep. Tricia Farley-Bouvier bill (H 76) would also exempt from that prohibition radio, TV stations, newspapers and magazines who air the ads or report on the ads, as long as they acknowledge that there are \u201cquestions about its authenticity,\u201d according to House Speaker Ron Mariano\u2019s office.\u201cAs artificial intelligence continues to reshape our economy and many aspects of our daily lives, lawmakers have a responsibility to ensure that AI does not further the spread of misinformation in our politics,\u201d Mariano and House Ways and Means Chair Aaron Michlewitz said in a statement. The House also plans to take up a Ways and Means redraft of a Minority Leader Brad Jones bill (H 846) that would require that \u201csynthetic media\u201d \u2014 audio or video content produced by AI intended to influence voting for a candidate or ballot proposition \u2014 disclose that it contains AI-generated materials at its start and end.Violators would face a fine of up to $1,000 under the legislation, which would also officially define the term \u201cgenerative artificial intelligence.\u201d",
