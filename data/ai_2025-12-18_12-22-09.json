    "description": "WAN CHAI, HONG KONG, Dec. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WAN CHAI, HONG KONG - December 11, 2025 - -The pressure to produce faster has overshadowed the need to think deeper. As knowledge workers face mounting expectations to deliver insights, recommendations, and strategic decisions that carry real consequences, the gap between instant AI-generated answers and defendable, conviction-backed work has never been more apparent.The real opportunity isn't just faster AI deliveries-it's helping humans and AI align on what matters before moving to execution. Ponder, an AI-powered thinking platform backed by over $6 million in seed funding, addresses this challenge by creating a workspace designed specifically for how minds actually work.Unlike tools that prioritize speed over substance, Ponder focuses on helping professionals think through work that matters. Whether developing client presentations, formulating investment recommendations, or conducting complex research, knowledge workers cannot simply accept what AI generates and call it done. They need to explore angles, build conviction, and create work they can defend when questioned.\"Everyone else is building faster tools. We're building tools for deeper thinking and lasting insights,\" says Simon Sheng, Founder and CEO of Ponder AI. \"For work you'll be judged on, you can't just accept what AI generates. You have to think it through, explore angles, and align with AI on what truly matters-then let it handle the tedious work. That's the thinking space we've created.\"At the core of Ponder lies its AI mindmapping capability, which reimagines how knowledge workers visualize and structure their thinking. The platform's mindmap-based cognitive network system allows ideas to branch and connect naturally on an infinite canvas, creating knowledge maps that match how minds actually work. Rather than forcing linear thinking into rigid document structures, Ponder enables users to build visual networks where concepts relate to each other organically, revealing patterns and connections that might remain hidden in traditional text-based formats. This AI-enhanced mindmapping goes beyond static diagrams, creating dynamic thinking spaces that evolve as understanding deepens.As an AI research tool, Ponder transforms how professionals gather, process, and internalize information. Users can start anywhere by asking a question, dropping in files, or exploring their existing knowledge base and instantly create a research environment tailored to their inquiry. The platform eliminates the fragmented workflow that has researchers constantly switching between ChatGPT for queries, Notion for organization, and other tools for output. Instead, Ponder provides an integrated research space where exploration, organization, and creation happen seamlessly on a visual canvas that keeps context always visible.The AI research capabilities extend beyond simple information retrieval. Ponder enables genuine conversations with knowledge that are anchored in visual context. Unlike standalone chat interfaces, researchers can ask follow-up questions, challenge ideas, and explore what-if scenarios while seeing how each insight connects within their evolving knowledge map. This approach mirrors how human curiosity actually works, allowing users to dive deeper into topics, pivot when new questions emerge, and build comprehensive understanding where every piece of information finds its place in the bigger picture. The platform's ability to handle complex research workflows within a unified visual workspace makes it particularly valuable for analysts, academics, and professionals who need to synthesize information from multiple angles before reaching conclusions.The Ponder Agent serves as an AI thinking companion that walks alongside users throughout their research and ideation process, working directly within the knowledge map to suggest branches, surface connections, and guide exploration. Rather than providing instant answers that users cannot defend, the Agent helps professionals navigate their visual thinking space, guiding them across questions, insights, and new directions while maintaining human agency in the thinking process. This collaborative dynamic ensures that users develop genuine understanding and conviction, not just surface-level knowledge.The integration of AI mindmapping and research tools within Ponder creates a powerful environment for human-AI co-creation. Researchers and analysts can visualize their inquiry on the infinite canvas, use AI to explore different dimensions of their questions, and watch their knowledge maps grow organically as they uncover new connections. This visual-conversational approach aligns thinking with structure, addressing a fundamental challenge in knowledge work: how to think deeply and systematically without losing sight of the bigger picture or getting lost in disconnected fragments of information.For knowledge professionals using Ponder, the platform represents a fundamental shift in cognitive workflows. The unified approach enables users to move from scattered thinking to defendable work more efficiently than traditional fragmented workflows. Users no longer waste time copying information between tools or reconstructing their thought process across different platforms. Everything happens in one thinking space, with AI supporting rather than replacing human intelligence.Ponder AI Limited, operating across Hong Kong, Singapore, and San Francisco, has positioned its platform to serve one billion knowledge professionals worldwide. The company's vision extends beyond creating another productivity tool to reimagining how humans and AI collaborate on cognitive work-where alignment comes before automation. By building infrastructure for thinking rather than merely executing, Ponder addresses the increasingly critical need for tools that support intellectual depth in an age that often mistakes speed for intelligence.As professionals face growing complexity in their work, the combination of AI mindmapping and AI research tools within Ponder offers a compelling alternative to fragmented workflows and superficial AI interactions. The platform enables users to explore deeply, organize naturally, and create deliverables they can confidently stand behind.Additional information about Ponder is available at Ponder.ing.###For more information about Ponder AI, contact the company here:Ponder AISimon Sheng+44 7505 472452S.SHENG@PONDER.INGFLAT A1, 11/F, SUCCESS COMMERCIAL BUILDING, 245-251 HENNESSY ROAD, WAN CHAI, HONG KONGCONTACT: Simon Sheng",
