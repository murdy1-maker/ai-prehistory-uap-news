    "title": "AI and anonymity fuel surge in digital violence against women",
    "description": "What was once hailed as a vehicle for empowerment has, for millions of women and girls, become a source of fear.Fuelled by artificial intelligence, anonymity, and weak accountability, online abuse is rapidly escalating. Yet, 1.8 billion women and girls still lack legal protection from online harassment and other forms of technology-facilitated abuse.The alarm is being sounded this week by the UN agency for women's rights, gender equality and women's empowerment (UN Women) as the 16 Days of Activism campaign begins, calling for urgent action against soaring digital violence.The space has become a frontline in the fight for gender equality, with less than 40 per cent of countries having laws addressing cyber harassment or cyberstalking, leaving perpetrators largely unchallenged and victims without justice.\u2018What begins online, doesn\u2019t stay online\u2019For women, the internet offers both empowerment and danger: a place for expression and opportunity, but also a growing weapon in the hands of abusers.Women leaders, journalists, activists, and public figures face relentless gendered disinformation, deepfake attacks, and coordinated harassment campaigns designed to silence, shame, and push them out of public life. One in four women journalists report receiving online death threats.\u201cWhat begins online doesn\u2019t stay online. Digital abuse spills into real life, spreading fear, silencing voices, and - in the worst cases - leading to physical violence and femicide,\u201d said UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous.Adding that laws must evolve with technology to ensure that justice protects women both online and offline, Ms. Bahous added that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that weak legal protections still leave millions of women and girls vulnerable, while perpetrators act with impunity.Through its 16 Days of Activism campaign, UN Women calls for a world where technology serves equality, not harm.AI drives new wave of digital abuseThe rise of AI has dramatically amplified digital abuse, making it faster, more targeted, and harder to detect. According to one global survey, 38 per cent of women have experienced online violence, and 85 per cent have witnessed it.AI-powered deepfake technology is being weaponised on a large scale: up to 95 per cent of online deepfakes are non-consensual pornographic images, and 99 per cent of those targeted are women.Digital abuse isn\u2019t confined to screens. Online attacks quickly spill into real life, escalating in severity.Many deepfake tools, developed by male teams, are not even designed to work on images of men, underscoring the gendered nature of this technology.UN Women urges tech companies to step up by hiring more women, creating safer online spaces, swiftly removing harmful content, and responding effectively to reports of abuse.Activist Laura Bates warns against minimising the harm. \u201cThe online-offline divide is an illusion,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen a domestic abuser uses online tools to track or stalk a victim, when abusive pornographic deepfakes cause a victim to lose her job or access to her children, when online abuse of a young woman results in offline slut-shaming and she drops out of school \u2013 these are just some examples that show how easily and dangerously digital abuse spills into real life.\u201dLegislation a work in progressFrom the UK's Online Safety Act to Mexico\u2019s Ley Olimpia - Australia\u2019s Online Safety Act and the EU\u2019s Digital Safety Act \u2013 change is on the way.As of 2025, 117 countries report efforts to address digital violence, but progress remains fragmented and regulation often lags technological advances.AI and technology policy experts are calling for stronger global cooperation and more effective laws to address AI-driven digital abuse.Policymakers must tailor approaches to national contexts and cultural realities rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all model for AI governance.Prevention beyond punishmentUN Women emphasises that prevention must go beyond punishment. It calls for companies to hire more women in tech development, build safer platforms, remove harmful content swiftly, and embed accountability into AI design.The UN agency also stresses investments in digital literacy, especially for young people, and culture-change programmes that challenge toxic online communities, including the growing \u201cmanosphere\u201d.Listen back to our interview with UN Women\u2019s Kalliopi Mingeirou, who leads the effort to end violence against women and girls, on the alarming spread of online misogyny:Feminist movements \u2013 often first responders in this crisis \u2013 face shrinking civic space and funding cuts, making initiatives like the EU-funded ACT to End Violence against Women and Girls programme vital to sustaining progress.\u201cTechnology can be a force for equality \u2014 but only if we build it that way,\u201d added Ms. Bahous.From 25 November to 10 December join the #NoExcuse campaign to learn about and take action to stop digital abuse against women and girls.",

It is also demanding that Dutch authorities reinstate its full shareholder rights. In a Thursday statement, Wingtech asserted that the Dutch government\u2019s suspension of an administrative freeze on Nexperia\u2019s assets was not enough, as it failed to reverse a prior court ruling that transferred control of its stake to a court-appointed trustee.
